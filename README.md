# AudioCraft model implementatnion for DeSota 
Horayy first huggingface model on desota

This implements two models for desota:
audiocraft/text-to-music
audiocraft/music-to-music
(BOTH are Research only and will run free of charge & will not generate credits due to how Meta licenses the model itself)

It is implemented by using a dependecy environment
we should be able to add more hugginface models this way, 
will probably have to add more requirements in the py env dep (spacewalkingninja/transforers)
